 // This is some javascript code
//  console.log("Hello world!")

//  let name = "Mosh";  //using "name" as a variable name is now deprecated, meaning it'll still work but its use is discouraged
//  console.log(name);

 // Cannot be a reserved keyword
 // Should be meaningful
 // Cannot start with a number(1name)
 // Cannot contain a space or hyphen (-)
 // Are case-sensitive

 // How to declare multiple variables( best practice)
 //let firstName, lastName, middleName; //not this

//  let firstName = "Clay"; 
//  let lastName = "Baruch";  //like these
//  let middleName = "Carney"; //make sure to end line in semi-colon

 
// Best Practice let vs. const: Use const by default when you don't need to reassign a variable, otherwise use let. 
//  let interestRate = 0.3;
//  interestRate = 1; // This is reassigning the value of interestRate from 0.3 to 1, and will appear so in the console
//  console.log(interestRate);

//  const percentageRate = 0.4;
//  percentageRate = 2.5;  // You cannot reassign a const and so this will throw an error in the console
//  console.log(percentageRate);
